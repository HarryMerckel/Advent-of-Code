# Advent of Code

Here are my (often bad) solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I've attempted parts of AoC before, but this is a fresh set of attempts started in 2020.

### Current progress

In the table below, a single \* means I've completed 1/2 of the day's puzzles, and \*\* means I've completed both.

If I can be bothered I'll go through and link each set of stars to that day's solution.
